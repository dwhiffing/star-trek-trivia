Thematics
  A temporal anomaly is threatening the safety of universe.

Objective
  Answer questions about TNG correctly to move through the sector. Collect 6 temporal fragments and find Q to win!

Gameplay
  Players move ships positioned on a tree of nodes
  Each turn, a player is asked a question.  If answered correctly, a player can move their ship
  If answered incorrectly and the player has a shield, they get another attempt
  When moving, you can either go left or right
  Players can scroll up and down to see the entire sector
  
  When landing on a node, different things can happen depending on the nodes color
    if the player lands on a red node, they have an encounter with a hostile alien
      Crystalline Entity (Hard)
      Borg (Hard)
      Cardasians (Medium)
      Romulan (Medium)
      Nausicans (Easy)
      Pakled (Easy)

    if the player lands on a green node, they have an encounter with a friendly/neutral alien
      Klingon: Right: Photon torpedoes (eliminate one of the options for multiple choice)
      Vulcan: Right: Upgraded engines (move up to 2 nodes)
      Bajoran: Right: Upgraded shields (get a second chance on your next question)
  
    if the player lands on a blue node, they can transport to any other blue node
